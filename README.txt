# CoqReferenceGuide


I have created a LaTeX document which highlights (in order of what I consider to be important) elements of the tools built up through the Software Foundations book (https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html)

Chapters which have had the important theorems added to this document:
Basics.v
Induction.v
Logic.v
Poly.v
Tactics.v 
LogicIntro1.v (Distributed in my class. The Logical Theorems section may have proofs that you don't have. None of them are very hard to prove but are still handy)


Feel free to fork or submit PRs if you think things are lacking / could be improved.
